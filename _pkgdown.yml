- title: Setting up a mizerReef model
  desc:  >
        These functions are for setting up a new mizerReef model and finding a
        steady state for the dynamical system.
- contents: has_concept("setup")
- title: Tuning a mizerReef model
  desc:  >
        These functions are for calibrating mizerReef models to match empirical
        observations.
- contents: has_concept("calibration")
- subtitle: Tuning Profiles
  desc:  >
        These refuge profiles are useful for tuning mizerReef models to steady 
        state.

- title: Predation Refuge
  desc:  >
        These functions set up the mediation of predation with refuge.
- subtitle: Setting the refuge parameters
  desc:  >
        These functions allow users to set or change the refuge profile.
- contents: has_concept("refugeParams")
- subtitle: New Rate Functions
  desc:  >
        These functions supplement or replace mizer's default rate functions
        so that refuge impacts simulations.
- contents: has_concept("refugeRates")
- subtitle: Degradation
  desc:  >
        These functions prepare a mizer model for projections with degradation.
- contents: has_concept("degradation")
- subtitle: Plotting the refuge profile
  desc:  >
        These functions allow users visualize the refuge profile for different
        functional groups in terms of their body length.
- contents: has_concept("refugePlots")
- title: Unstructured Resources
  desc:  >
        These functions set up the production and consumption dynamics for the 
        algae and detritus resources and provide some plotting abilities to
        assess these dynamics.

- title: External Mortality
  desc:  >
        These functions add size-dependent senescence mortality to mizerReef 
        models.
- contents: has_concept("extmort")
- title: Summary Functions
- contents: has_concept("summary")
- title: Summary Plots 
  desc:  >
        These functions calculate and plot summary statistics and allow for the 
        comparison of results between different models.

- title: Example Models
  desc:  >
        These files hold example parameters and mizer params object to explore
        models set up to emulate the coral reefs of Bonaire.
- subtitle: Simple trait based model
- desc: >
        This simple trait based model divides reef organisms into three broad
        groups based on diet: predators, herbivores, and invertebrates.

- subtitle: Multi-species model
- desc: >
        This multi-species model contains 10 species groups based on diet,
        body size and shape, functional role, and relationship to habitat
        structural complexity.
