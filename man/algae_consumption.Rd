\title{Mass-specific algae consumption rate}
\usage{
algae_consumption(params, n = params@initial_n, rates = getRates(params))
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{MizerParams}

\item{n}{A matrix of current species abundances (species x size)}

\item{rates}{A list of rates as returned by \code{\link[=getRates]{getRates()}}}
}
\value{
The mass-specific consumption rate of algae in grams per year.
}
\description{
This mass-specific consumption rate is used in \code{algae_dynamics()} to
calculate the algae biomass at the next time step. To get the
non-mass-specific consumption rate, use \code{getAlgaeConsumption()}.
}
\details{
The consumption rate by herbivorous fish is determined by
\code{other_params(params)$algae$rho}
}
