\title{Expected algae lifetime}
\usage{
algae_lifetime(params)

algae_lifetime(params) <- value
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A MizerParams object}

\item{value}{A number with the new value for the expected lifetime in years

Assigning a new value to the algae lifetime rescales the algae
abundance while keeping the total consumption of algae the same (by
adjusting the interaction strength of species with algae).}
}
\value{
The number giving the expected lifetime in years.
}
\description{
The expected algae lifetime is defined as the inverse of the
mass-specific algae consumption rate.
}
