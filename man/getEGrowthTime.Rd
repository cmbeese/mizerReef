\title{Get energy rate available for growth through time}
\usage{
getEGrowthTime(params, n, n_pp, n_other, time_range, drop = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A \linkS4class{MizerParams} object}

\item{n}{A matrix of species abundances (species x size).}

\item{n_pp}{A vector of the resource abundance by size}

\item{n_other}{A list of abundances for other dynamical components of the
ecosystem}

\item{...}{Unused}
}
\value{
If a \code{MizerParams} object is passed in, the function returns a two
dimensional array (predator species x predator size) based on the
abundances also passed in.
If a \code{MizerSim} object is passed in, the function returns a three
dimensional array (time step x predator species x predator size) with the
energy for growth calculated at every time step in the simulation.
If \code{drop = TRUE} then the dimension of length 1 will be removed from
the returned array.
}
\description{
Calculates the energy rate \eqn{g_i(w)} (grams/year) available by
species and size for growth after metabolism, movement and
reproduction have been accounted for.
