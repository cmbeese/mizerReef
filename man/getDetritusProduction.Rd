\usage{
getDetritusProduction(params, n = params@initial_n, rates = getRates(params))
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{MizerParams}

\item{n}{A matrix of current species abundances (species x size)}

\item{rates}{A list of rates as returned by \code{\link[=getRates]{getRates()}}}
}
\value{
A vector with named entries "feces", "decomp", and "external",
giving the rates at which detritus biomass is produced by each of these
sources in grams per year.
}
\description{
Gives a named vector with the rates at which different components of the
ecosystem produce detritus:
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item consumed biomass not assimilated by predators ("feces"),
\item decomposing dead organisms ("decomp"),
\item the pelagic zone ("external").
}

This function returns a vector with the individual contributions for each
source. These can be summed with \code{sum()} to get the total detritus
production rate.

\section{Detritus production}{


\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ The rate \eqn{p_D} at which detritus biomass is produced by the 
 ecosystem has contributions from three sources:
 
 \deqn{p_D = p_{D.f} + p_{D.d} + p_{D.ext}}{
           p_D = p_{D.f} + p_{D.d} + p_{D.ext}}
       
 \eqn{p_{D.f}} comes from the biomass that is consumed but not 
 assimilated and is given by:
 
 \deqn{p_{D.f} = \sum_i(1-\alpha_i)\int E_i(w)\,dw}{
           p_{D.f} = \sum_i(1-\alpha_i)\int E_i(w)\,dw}
       
 \eqn{p_{D.d}} comes from the biomass of fish that die as a result of 
 external mortality. External mortality includes local deaths that lead 
 to detritus but also deaths due to predation by species that are not
 explicitly modelled, for example transient predators, mammals, or sea 
 birds. Thus, only a proportion `prop_decomp` of this material 
 decomposes to detritus. The detritus production from decomposing 
 dead organisms is given by:
 
 \deqn{p_{D.d} = \sum_i\int\mu_{seni.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw + 
                     \mathtt{prop\_decomp}\,
                     \sum_i\int\mu_{nat.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw}{
         p_{D.d} = \sum_i\int\mu_{seni.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw + 
                     \mathtt{prop\_decomp}\,
                     \sum_i\int\mu_{nat.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw}
                 
 \eqn{p_{D.ext}} is the rate at which detritus enters the system from
 unmodelled or external sources. For coral reefs, this includes detritus
 produced by sponges and coral mucous as well as waste material that 
 sinks in from the pelagic zone. This rate is a model parameter 
 independent of any other model component. It is set so that production 
 and consumption are equal for the chosen steady state abundances.
