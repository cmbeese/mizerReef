\title{Detritus production rate}
\usage{
getDetritusProduction(params, n = params@initial_n, rates = getRates(params))
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{MizerParams}

\item{n}{A matrix of current species abundances (species x size)}

\item{rates}{A list of rates as returned by \code{\link[=getRates]{getRates()}}}
}
\value{
A vector with named entries "feces", "decomp", and "external",
giving the rates at which detritus biomass is produced by each of these
sources in grams per year.
}
\description{
Gives a named vector with the rates at which different components of the
ecosystem produce detritus:
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item consumed biomass not assimilated by predators ("feces"),
\item decomposing dead organisms ("decomp"),
\item the pelagic zone ("external").
}

mizerReef models include two sources of external mortality to describe all
deaths by natural causes that are not due to predation by the modelled
species. External mortality includes deaths that lead to detritus, but also
deaths due to predation by species that are not explicitly modelled, for
example transient predators, mammals, or sea birds. Thus, only a proportion
of this material will stay in the system to decompose. The parameter
\code{prop_decomp} describes the proportion of external mortality that stays in
the system and decomposes to detritus.

External detritus is waste material that sinks in from the pelagic zone.
This rate is a model parameter independent of any other model component. It
is set so that production and consumption are equal for chosen steady state
abundances.

The function returns a vector with the individual contributions for each
source. These can be summed with \code{sum()} to get the total detritus
production rate.
