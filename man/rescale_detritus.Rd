An updated MizerParams object

\description{
This multiplies the detritus biomass by a factor and divides the
interaction between all species and the detritus by the same
factor, so as to keep the total consumption of detritus unchanged.
It also divides the mass-specific rate of decomposition by the same
factor so that the total detritus decomposition rate stays the same.
