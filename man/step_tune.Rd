\title{Stepped refuge profile for tuning steady states}

\description{
This is a 2-dimensional array containing start and end lengths for size bins
and prop_protect decreasing from 30\% to 10\% over the ten bins.
}
\details{
This profile provides more protection to smaller size classes than larger
ones, as would be observed on a natural reef.

These refuge parameters are intended for tuning the steady state when
using the density-dependent competitive method. The tuning profile provides
a constant proportion of refuges to all fish up to 50 cm in length.

When creating a model using the competitive method, you should run
\code{\link[=newReefParams]{newReefParams()}} with the "binned" method and thing tuning profile.

After species biomasses and growth rates have been calibrated to match
empirical observations, use the \code{\link[=newRefuge]{newRefuge()}} function to implement your
competitive refuge parameters. After using \code{\link[=newRefuge]{newRefuge()}},  make sure to
iterate through \code{\link[mizer:matchBiomasses]{mizer:: matchBiomasses()}}, \code{\link[=matchReefGrowth]{matchReefGrowth()}}, and
\code{\link[=reefSteady]{reefSteady()}} again to regain the steady state.
