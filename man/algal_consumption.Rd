\title{Mass-specific algal consumption rate}
\usage{
algal_consumption(params, n = params@initial_n, rates = getRates(params))
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{MizerParams}

\item{n}{A matrix of current species abundances (species x size)}

\item{rates}{A list of rates as returned by \code{\link[=getRates]{getRates()}}}
}
\value{
The mass-specific consumption rate of algae in grams per year.
}
\description{
This mass-specific consumption rate is used in \code{algal_dynamics()} to
calculate the algal biomass at the next time step. To get the
non-mass-specific consumption rate, use \code{getAlgalConsumption()}.
}
\details{
The rho parameter for herbivorous fish groups is stored in
\code{other_params(params)$algae$rho}
}
\section{Algal consumption}{


The rate at which herbivorous consumer groups encounter algal
biomass \eqn{E_{i.A}(w)} is controlled by the parameter
\eqn{\rho_{A.i}}. It scales with the size of the consumer raised to
an allometric exponent \eqn{m_{alg}} which is taken from empirical data.

\deqn{E_{i.A}(w)=\rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}}\,B_A}{
       E_{i.A}(w)= rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}}\,B_A}

The mass specific consumption rate then accounts for the preference of
functional group $i$ for algae, \eqn{\theta_{i.A}}. This gives the
mass-specific algal consumption rate:

\deqn{c_A = \sum_i\int\rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}} N_i(w)\theta_{i.A}\,dw}{
       c_A = \sum_i\int rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}} N_i(w) theta_{i.A}\,dw}
}
