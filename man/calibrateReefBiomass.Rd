\title{Calibrate the scale of a mizerReef model to match total observed biomass}
\usage{
calibrateReefBiomass(params)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A MizerParams object}
}
\value{
A MizerParams object
}
\description{
This function replaces mizer's calibrateBiomass function to include
unstructured resources. Given a Mizer Params object, it returns an updated
MizerParams object which is rescaled with \code{\link[=scaleReefModel]{scaleReefModel()}} so that the
total biomass in the model agrees with the total observed biomass.
}
\details{
Biomass observations usually only include individuals above a certain size.
This size should be specified in a biomass_cutoff column of the species
parameter data frame. If this is missing, it is assumed that all sizes are
included in the observed biomass, i.e., it includes larval biomass.

After using this function the total biomass in the model will match the
total biomass, summed over all species. However the biomasses of the
individual species will not match observations yet, with some species
having biomasses that are too high and others too low. So after this
function use the mizer function matchReefBiomasses() to match the
biomasses for each group.
