\title{Tune unstructured resources with carrying capacities
(algae and detritus) to steady state}
\usage{
tuneUR_cc(params, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A MizerParams object}

\item{...}{unused}
}
\value{
An updated MizerParams object
}
\description{
For models that use unstructured resources with carrying capacities,
this functions sets the production rates of detritus and algae so
that productions equals consumption at steady state.
}
\details{
The growth of rate of algae is set to \eqn{(c_A \cdot B_A)/(1-\frac{B_A}{K_A}}
grams per meter squared per year.

The external production of detritus is set to
\eqn{(c_D \cdot B_D)/(1-\frac{B_D}{K_D} - P_{D.f} - P_{D.d}} grams per meter
squared per year.
