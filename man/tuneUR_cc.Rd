\description{
For models that use unstructured resources with carrying capacities,
this functions sets the production rates of detritus and algae so
that productions equals consumption at steady state.
}
\details{
With a carrying capacity, the time evolution of the algae biomass
\eqn{B_A(t)} is described by

\deqn{ \frac{dB_A}{dt} = P_A\left( 1 - 
                         \frac{B_A}{K_A} \right) - c_A \, B_A }{
                dB_A/dt = P_A * (1 - B_A/ K_A) - c_A * B_A}

where \eqn{K_A} is the system's carrying capacity for algae in grams/ year,
\eqn{c_A} is the mass-specific rate of consumption calculated with
\code{algae_consumption()} and \eqn{P_A} is the rate at which algae
grows, calculated with \code{getAlgaeProduction()}.

In this tuning function, the growth of rate of algae is set to
\eqn{(c_A \cdot B_A)/(1-\frac{B_A}{K_A})} grams per meter squared per year
so that consumption is equal to production for steady state.

Similarly, the time evolution of the detritus biomass \eqn{B_D(t)} is
described by

\deqn{ \frac{dB_D}{dt} = P_D\left( 1 - 
                         \frac{B_D}{K_D} \right) - c_D \, B_D }{
                dB_D/dt = P_D * (1 - B_D/ K_D) - c_D * B_D}

where \eqn{K_D} is the system's carrying capacity for detritus in grams/ year,
\eqn{c_D} is the mass-specific rate of consumption calculated with
\code{detritus_consumption()} and \eqn{P_D} is the rate at which detritus
is produced calculated with \code{getDetritusProduction()}. Total detritus
production is given with

\deqn{p_D = p_{D.f} + p_{D.d} + p_{D.ext}}{
       p_D = p_{D.f} + p_{D.d} + p_{D.ext}}

In this tuning function, the external production of detritus is set to
\eqn{(c_D \cdot B_D)/(1-\frac{B_D}{K_D}) - P_{D.f} - P_{D.d}} grams per meter
squared per year so that production equals consumption at steady state.
