\usage{
getAlgaeConsumption(params)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{MizerParams}

\value{
A named vector with the consumption rates from herbivores
}
\description{
This function returns a named vector with one component for each species
giving the rate in grams/year at which that species consumes algae
}
\section{Algae consumption}{


The rate at which herbivorous consumer groups encounter algal
biomass \eqn{E_{i.A}(w)} is controlled by the parameter
\eqn{\rho_{A.i}}. It scales with the size of the consumer raised to
an allometric exponent \eqn{m_{alg}} which is taken from empirical data.

\deqn{E_{i.A}(w)=\rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}}\,B_A}{
       E_{i.A}(w)= rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}}\,B_A}

The mass specific consumption rate then accounts for the preference of
functional group $i$ for algae, \eqn{\theta_{i.A}}. This gives the
mass-specific algae consumption rate:

\deqn{c_A = \sum_i\int\rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}} N_i(w)\theta_{i.A}\,dw}{
       c_A = \sum_i\int rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}} N_i(w) theta_{i.A}\,dw}
}
