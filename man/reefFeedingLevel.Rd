\title{Get feeding level needed to project a mizerReef model}
\usage{
reefFeedingLevel(params, n, n_pp, n_other, t, encounter, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A \linkS4class{MizerParams} object}

\item{n}{A matrix of species abundances (species x size).}

\item{n_pp}{A vector of the resource abundance by size}

\item{n_other}{A list of abundances for other dynamical components of the
ecosystem}

\item{t}{The time for which to do the calculation (Not used by standard
mizer rate functions but useful for extensions with time-dependent
parameters.)}

\item{encounter}{A two dimensional array (predator species x predator size)
with the encounter rate.}

\item{...}{Unused}
}
\value{
A two dimensional array (predator species x predator size) with the
feeding level.
}
\description{
You would not usually call this function directly but instead use
\code{\link[=getFeedingLevel]{getFeedingLevel()}}.

\section{Feeding level}{


\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ In mizerReef models, feeding level only applies to herbivorous and
 detritivorous functional groups. Predation is regulated by refuge.
 The feeding level \eqn{f_i(w)} is the proportion of its maximum intake
 rate at which the consumer is actually taking in algae or detritus. It
 is calculated from the encounter rate \eqn{E_i} and the maximum intake
 rate \eqn{h_i(w)} as:

  \deqn{f_i(w) = \frac{E_i(w)}{E_i(w)+h_i(w)}.}{E_i(w)/(E_i(w)+h_i(w)).}

  The encounter rate \eqn{E_i} is passed as an argument or calculated
  with [getEncounter()]. The maximum intake rate \eqn{h_i(w)} is taken
  from the `params` object, and is set with [setMaxIntakeRate()].

  As a consequence of the above expression for the feeding level,
  \eqn{1-f_i(w)} is the proportion of the detritus or algae available
  to a consumer that it actually consumes.
