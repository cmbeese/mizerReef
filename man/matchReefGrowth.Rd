\title{Match observed growth rates}
\usage{
matchReefGrowth(params, species = NULL, keep = c("egg", "biomass", "number"))
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A MizerParams object}

\item{species}{The species to be affected. Optional. By default all species
for which growth information is available will be affected. A vector of
species names, or a numeric vector with the species indices, or a logical
vector indicating for each species whether it is to be affected (TRUE) or
not.}

\item{keep}{A string determining which quantity is to be kept constant. The
choices are "egg" which keeps the egg density constant, "biomass" which
keeps the total biomass of the species constant and "number" which keeps
the total number of individuals constant.}
}
\value{
A modified MizerParams object with rescaled rates and rescaled
species parameters \code{gamma},\code{h}, \code{ks} and \code{k}.
}
\description{
This does the same as \code{mizer::matchGrowth()} but in addition also rescales
the consumption rates of algae and detritus.
