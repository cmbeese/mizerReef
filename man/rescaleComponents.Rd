\title{Rescale algae and detritus biomass without changing anything else}
\usage{
rescaleComponents(params, algae_factor = 1, detritus_factor = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A MizerParams object}

\item{algae_factor}{A number to scale algae by}

\item{detritus_factor}{A number to scale detritus by}
}
\value{
An updated MizerParams object
}
\description{
This multiplies the algae & detritus biomass by a factor and divides the
