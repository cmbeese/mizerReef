ecosystem}

mizer rate functions but useful for extensions with
time-dependent parameters.)}

\section{Senescence mortality}{


\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ Senescence mortality \eqn{\mu_{sen.i}(w)} is used to represent
 mortality caused by external sources such as illness or age. This is
 addition to external mortality, \eqn{\mu_{ext.i}(w)}, which represents
 all mortality that is not due to fishing or predation by predators
 included in the model. The rate of senescence mortality is given by:

 \deqn{\mu_{sen.i}(w) = k_{sen}\left(\frac{w}{w_{max.i}}\right)^{p_{sen}}}
      \{\\mu_\{sen.i\}(w) = k_\{sen\} (w/w_\{max.i\})^\{p_\{sen\}\}

 where \eqn{k_{sen}} and \eqn{p_sen} are constants defining the shape
 of the senescence curve and \eqn{w_max.i} is the maximum size
 of species \eqn{i} in grams.

 Users can change all constants with the `setSenMortParams()` function.
