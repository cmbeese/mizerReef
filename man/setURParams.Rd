\item{UR_interaction}{Interaction matrix for unstructured resources
(species x resource)

Optional parameters:}

\item{algae_growth}{The initial growth rate of algae in grams/year/m^-2.
This value is reset to match consumption in the \verb{[reefSteady()]}  function
so that steady state abundances match given values.}

\item{prop_decomp}{The proportion of waste material that decomposes to
become part of the detritus pool.}

\item{d.external}{The rate at which detritus biomass sinks from the pelagic
zone and becomes part of the detritus pool in grams per year. This value
is reset to make up any differences in consumption and production in
the \verb{[reefSteady()]} function so that steady state abundances match
observed values.}

\section{Adding unstructured resources}{


\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ mizerReef supports two resource spectra that are not size- structured.
 Algae is consumed by herbivorous fish, while detritus is consumed by
 herbivorous fish and benthic invertebrates. This function sets the 
 interaction matrix for these resources as well as any default
 parameters necessary to structure them.

 The resource interaction matrix \eqn\{\\theta_\{ki\} modifies the
 interaction of each functional group \eqn{i} with each unstructured
 resource \eqn{k} in the model. This can be used for example to allow 
 for different diet preferences on each unstructured resource. 
 
 Note that interaction with size structured resources, such as
 plankton, is still set with the `resource_interaction` column of
 the species parameters dataframe.
