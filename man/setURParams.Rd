\section{Adding unstructured resources}{


\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ mizerReef supports two resource spectra that are not size- structured.
 Algae is consumed by herbivorous fish, while detritus is consumed by
 herbivorous fish and benthic invertebrates. This function sets the 
 interaction matrix for these resources as well as any default
 parameters necessary to structure them.

 The resource interaction matrix \eqn\{\\theta_\{ki\} modifies the
 interaction of each functional group \eqn{i} with each unstructured
 resource \eqn{k} in the model. This can be used for example to allow 
 for different diet preferences on each unstructured resource. 
 
 Note that interaction with size structured resources, such as
 plankton, is still set with the `resource_interaction` column of
 the species parameters dataframe.

\section{Detritus consumption}{


The rate at which detritivorous consumer groups encounter detrital
biomass \eqn{E_{i.D}(w)} is controlled by the parameter
\eqn{\rho_{D.i}}. It scales with the size of the consumer raised to
an allometric exponent \eqn{m_{det}} which is taken to be the same as
the scaling exponent of the maximum intake rate for fish consumers.

\deqn{E_{i.D}(w)=\rho_{i.D}\, w^{m_{det}}\,B_D }{
       E_{i.D}(w)=\rho_{i.D}\, w^{m_{det}}\,B_D}

The mass specific consumption rate then accounts for the preference of
functional group $i$ for detritus, \eqn{\theta_{i.D}} and the feeding
level \eqn{f_i(w)}. This gives the mass-specific detritus consumption
rate:

\deqn{c_D = \sum_i\int\rho_{i.D}\, w^{m_{det}} 
             N_i(w) \left(1-f_i(w)\right) \theta_{i.D}\,dw}{
       c_D = \sum_i\int\rho_{i.D}\, w^{m_{det}} 
             N_i(w) \left(1-f_i(w)\right) \theta_{i.D}\,dw}
}

\section{Detritus production}{


The rate \eqn{p_D} at which detritus biomass is produced by the
ecosystem has contributions from three sources:

\deqn{p_D = p_{D.f} + p_{D.d} + p_{D.ext}}{
       p_D = p_{D.f} + p_{D.d} + p_{D.ext}}

\eqn{p_{D.f}} comes from the biomass that is consumed but not
assimilated and is given by:

\deqn{p_{D.f} = \sum_i(1-\alpha_i)\int E_i(w)\,dw}{
       p_{D.f} = \sum_i(1-\alpha_i)\int E_i(w)\,dw}

\eqn{p_{D.d}} comes from the biomass of fish that die as a result of
external mortality. External mortality includes local deaths that lead
to detritus but also deaths due to predation by species that are not
explicitly modelled, for example transient predators, mammals, or sea
birds. Thus, only a proportion \code{prop_decomp} of this material
decomposes to detritus. The detritus production from decomposing
dead organisms is given by:

\deqn{p_{D.d} = \sum_i\int\mu_{seni.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw + 
                 \mathtt{prop\_decomp}\,
                 \sum_i\int\mu_{nat.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw}{
     p_{D.d} = \sum_i\int\mu_{seni.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw + 
                 \mathtt{prop\_decomp}\,
                 \sum_i\int\mu_{nat.i}(w)N_i(w)w\,dw}

\eqn{p_{D.ext}} is the rate at which detritus enters the system from
unmodelled or external sources. For coral reefs, this includes detritus
produced by sponges and coral mucous as well as waste material that
sinks in from the pelagic zone. This rate is a model parameter
independent of any other model component. It is set so that production
and consumption are equal for the chosen steady state abundances.

\section{Algae consumption}{


The rate at which herbivorous consumer groups encounter algal
biomass \eqn{E_{i.A}(w)} is controlled by the parameter
\eqn{\rho_{A.i}}. It scales with the size of the consumer raised to
an allometric exponent \eqn{m_alg} which is taken from empirical data.

\deqn{E_{i.A}(w)=\rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}}\,B_A}{
       E_{i.A}(w)=\rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}}\,B_A}

The mass specific consumption rate then accounts for the preference of
functional group $i$ for algae, \eqn{\theta_{i.A}}. This gives the
mass-specific algae consumption rate:

\deqn{c_A = \sum_i\int\rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}} N_i(w)\theta_{i.A}\,dw}{
       c_A = \sum_i\int\rho_{i.A}\, w^{m_{alg}} N_i(w)\theta_{i.A}\,dw}
}
