\section{Adding unstructured resources}{


\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ mizerReef supports two resource spectra that are not size- structured.
 Algae is consumed by herbivorous fish, while detritus is consumed by
 herbivorous fish and benthic invertebrates.

 The resource interaction matrix \eqn\{\\theta_\{ki\} modifies the
 interaction of each functional group \eqn{i} with each resource \eqn{k}
 in the model. This can be used for example to allow for different
 spatial overlap among the species. This function checks if provided
 unstructured resource interaction matrices are valid.

\section{Senescence mortality}{


\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ Senescence mortality is implemented by default in mizerReef. You do not
 need to set these parameters. This function should only be used to
 change default values.

 Senescence mortality \eqn{\mu_{sen.i}(w)} is used to represent
 mortality caused by external sources such as illness or age. This is
 addition to external mortality, \eqn{\mu_{ext.i}(w)}, which represents
 all mortality that is not due to fishing or predation by predators
 included in the model. The rate of senescence mortality is given by:

 \deqn{\mu_{sen.i}(w) = k_{sen}\left(\frac{w}{w_{max.i}}\right)^{p_{sen}}}
      \{\\mu_\{sen.i\}(w) = k_\{sen\}(w/w_\{max.i\})^\{p_\{sen\}\}\}

 where \eqn{k_{sen}} is the rate of senescence mortality, \eqn{p_sen}
 defines the slope of the senescence curve, \eqn{w_max.i} maximum body
 size of group \eqn{i} in grams.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\section{Setting the refuge profile}{


Refuge profiles account for the protective behavior of prey living in
high complexity environments (e.g. coral reefs) with access to predation
refuge. The refuge profile defines the proportion of fish within
user-defined length bins that are protected from being encountered
by a predator.

A unique refuge profile is generated for each predator x prey combination
based on the given refuge profile parameters as well as four values from
\code{params@species_params}: length to weight conversion values \code{a} and \code{b},
\code{refuge_user}, which is true for groups utilize that predation refuge,
and \code{bad_pred}, which is true for predators whose foraging is hindered
by refuge.

The refuge profile is used when calculating the food encounter rate in
\code{\link[=reefEncounter]{reefEncounter()}} and the predation mortality rate in \code{\link[=reefPredMort]{reefPredMort()}}. Its
entries are dimensionless numbers. If no refuge is available then
predator-prey interactions are determined entirely by size-preference.

The mizerReef package provides three methods to define the refuge profile:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{ 1. ``simple`` -  This method is preferred for data-poor reefs or reefs
 where the refuge distribution is unknown. It is also ideal for systems
 where only one functional group is expected to be utilizing refuge. The
 proportion of fish with access to refuge \eqn{ R_j(w_p) }$ is given by:

 \deqn{ R_j(w_p) =
         \frac{-ref}{1 + e^{\left(-\alpha (w - W_{max})\right)}} + ref }
     \{R_j(w_p) = -r/(1 + e^\{(-\\alpha (w - W_\{max\}))\} + ref \}

 where \eqn{W_{max}} defines the prey body size at which no crevices in
 the reef are large enough to act as a refuge. Refuge is available to a
 constant proportion \eqn{ref} of fish smaller than \eqn{W_{max}}. The
 slope \eqn{\alpha} describes the sharpness of the cutoff for fish
 larger than \eqn{W_{max}}. The default value for \eqn{\alpha} sets a
 steep slope of \eqn{100}.

 For this method, `method_params` should contain columns named
 `prop_protect` and `max_L` that give the proportion of fish to protect
 and the maximum length protected (cm), respectively.

 2. ``binned`` - This method is appropriate for theoretical applications
 and does not rely on empirical data. It sets refuge to a constant
 proportion of fish within a given size range. The  proportion of fish
 in group \eqn{j} with access to refuge is given by:

 \deqn{ R_j(w_p) = r_k ~~~~~~~ w_p ∈ (~w_{k-1}, w_k~] }
     \{R_j(w_p) = r_k ~~~~~~~ w_p ∈ (~w_\{k-1\}, w_k~]

 where \eqn{r_k} is the proportion of fish with access to refuge in
 size class \eqn{k}.

 For this method, `method_params` should contain columns named
 `start_L`and `end_L` which contain the starting and ending lengths (cm)
 of each size bin and `prop_protect`, the proportion protected within
 each corresponding size bin.

 3. ``data`` -  This method is appropriate when data on the number of
 refuge holes present within defined fish length bins is available. The
 proportion of fish in size class \eqn{k} with access to refuge is given
 by:

 \deqn{R_j(w_p) = \tau\cdot\frac{\eta_k}{\sum_{i}\int_{w_{k-1}}^{w_k}
     N_i(w)~dw}  ~~~~~~~ w_p ∈ (~w_{k-1}, w_k~]}
     \{R_j(w_p) = \\tau \\eta_k/(\\sum_\{i\}\\int_\{w_\{k-1\}\}^\{w_k\}
 N_i(w)~dw)  ~~~~~~~ w_p ∈ (~w_\{k-1\}, w_k~]\}

 where \eqn{\tau} is the proportion of fish with access to refuge that
 are expected to actually utilize  it, \eqn{\eta_k} is the density of
 refuges in size range \eqn{(w_{k-1}, w_k]} and
  \eqn{\sum_{i}\int_{w_{k-1}}^{w_k} N_i(w)~dw} gives the total
 number of fish from any group in size range \eqn{(w_{k-1}, w_k]}.
 This represents the density of competitors for refuges in
 size class \eqn{k}.

 For this method, `method_params` should contain columns named
 `start_L`and `end_L` which contain the starting and ending lengths (cm)
 of each size bin and `refuge_density`, the number of refuges available
 in each size bin.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

This function checks that the supplied refuge parameters are valid, adds
relevant columns to the \code{species_params} dataframe, and stores refuge
parameters in the \code{other_params} slot of the \code{params} object.

Refuge profile parameters can be input in a spreadsheet program and saved
as a .csv file. The data can then be read into R using the command
\code{read.csv()}.
