}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{MizerParams} or \code{MizerSim}. If given a
\linkS4class{MizerSim} object, uses the growth rates at the
final time of a simulation to calculate productivity. If
given a \linkS4class{MizerParams} object, uses the initial
growth rates.}

\item{min_fishing_l}{The minimum length (cm) of fished individuals for
productivity estimates. Defaults to 7 cm.}

\item{max_fishing_l}{The maximum length (cm) of fished individuals for
productivity estimates. Defaults to max length.}

  \describe{
    \item{\code{min_w}}{Smallest weight in size range. Defaults to smallest weight in
the model.}
    \item{\code{max_w}}{Largest weight in size range. Defaults to largest weight in the
model.}
    \item{\code{min_l}}{Smallest length in size range. If supplied, this takes
precedence over \code{min_w}.}

over \code{max_w}.}

}
\value{
If called with a MizerParams object, a vector with the productivity
in grams/year/m^-2 for each functional group in the model. If called with
a MizerSim object, an array (time x species) containing the productivity
at each time step for all species.

\section{Potential fisheries productivity}{


Fisheries productivity refers to the rate at which fish biomass is produced
and available for harvest in a given area over a given period of time.
Productivity cannot be measured in situ.

The productivity \eqn{P_i(w)} of functional group \eqn{i} is given by

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{\deqn{P_i(w) = \int_w^{w+dw} \left( N_i(w) + E_{R.i}(w) \right) w \, dw.}
     \{P_i(w) = \\int_w^\{w+dw\} ( N_i(w) + E_\{R.i\}(w)) w \\, dw.\}
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

\eqn{N_i(w)} is the abundance density (1/m^-2) and \eqn{E_{R.i}}
is the energy rate available for growth after metabolism and movement have
been accounted for (grams/year).

The productivity is calculated for all fish in the size range between
\code{min_fishing_length} and \code{max_fishing_length}which can be the same for
all functional groups or can be specified as a vector with one value for
each species in the model.\code{min_fishing_length} defaults to \eqn{7 cm}
regardless of functional group and \code{max_fishing_length} defaults to the
maximum weight in the model.
