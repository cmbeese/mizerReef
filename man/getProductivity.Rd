\title{Calculate fisheries productivity for each functional group above a chosen
minimum fishing size}
\usage{
getProductivity(object, min_fishing_l = 7, max_fishing_l = 50, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{MizerParams} or \code{MizerSim}.If given a
\linkS4class{MizerSim} object, uses the growth rates at the final time of a
simulation to calculate productivity. If given a \linkS4class{MizerParams}
object, uses the initial growth rates.}

\item{min_fishing_l}{The minimum length (cm) of fished individuals for
productivity estimates. Defaults to 7 cm.}

\item{max_fishing_l}{The maximum length (cm) of fished individuals for
productivity estimates. Defaults to max length.}

\item{...}{Unused}
}
\value{
If called with a MizerParams object, a vector with the productivity
in grams/year/m^-2 for each functional group in the model. If called with
a MizerSim object, an array (time x species) containing the productivity
at each time step for all species.
}
\description{
Fisheries productivity refers to the rate at which fish biomass is produced
and available for harvest in a given area over a given period of time.
Productivity cannot be measured in situ.
}
\details{
The productivity \eqn{P_i(w)} of functional group \eqn{i} is given by

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{\deqn{P_i(w) = \int_w^{w+dw} \left( N_i(w) + g_i(w) \right) w \, dw.}
     \{P_i(w) = \\int_w^\{w+dw\} \\left( N_i(w) + g_i(w) \\right) w \\, dw.\}
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

\eqn{N_i(w)} is the abundance density (1/m^-2) and \eqn{g_i(w)} is the
energy rate available for growth after metabolism, movement and
reproduction have been accounted for (grams/year).

The productivity is calculated for all fish in the size range between
\code{min_fishing_length} and \code{max_fishing_length}which can be the same for
all functional groups or can be specified as a vector with one value for
each species in the model.\code{min_fishing_length} defaults to \eqn{7 cm}
regardless of functional group and \code{max_fishing_length} defaults to the
maximum weight in the model.
