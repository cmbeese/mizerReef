\usage{
getProductivity(
  object,
  time_range = NULL,
  include_repro = FALSE,
  min_fishing_l = NULL,
  max_fishing_l = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{MizerParams} or \code{MizerSim}. If given a
\linkS4class{MizerSim} object, uses the growth rates at the
final time of a simulation to calculate productivity. If
given a \linkS4class{MizerParams} object, uses the initial
growth rates.}

\item{time_range}{The time range (either a vector of values, a vector of min
and max time, or a single value) to provide productivity
for. Default is the final time step. Ignored when called
with a \linkS4class{MizerParams} object.}

\item{include_repro}{A boolean value that indicates whether to include
energy for reproduction in productivity estimates.
Defaults to using \code{\link[=getEGrowthTime]{getEGrowthTime()}} if FALSE or
mizer's \code{\link[mizer:getEReproAndGrowth]{mizer::getEReproAndGrowth()}} if TRUE.}

\item{min_fishing_l}{The minimum length (cm) of fished individuals for
productivity estimates. Defaults to 7 cm.}

\item{max_fishing_l}{The maximum length (cm) of fished individuals for
productivity estimates. Defaults to max length.}
}
\value{
If called with a MizerParams object, a vector with the productivity
in \eqn{\frac{grams}{m^2}/year} for each species group in the model.
If called with a MizerSim object, an array (time x species)
containing the total productivity at each time step for each
species.
}
\description{
This function calculates the total potential fisheries productivity by
species group in a given size range using species abundances and
the \code{\link[=getEGrowthTime]{getEGrowthTime()}} function.

\section{Potential fisheries productivity}{


Productivity refers to the rate at which fish biomass is produced
and available for harvest in a given area over a given period of time.
Productivity cannot be measured in situ.

The productivity \eqn{P_i(w)} of species group \eqn{i} is given by

\deqn{P_i(w) = \int_w^{w+dw} \left( N_i(w) + g_i(w) \right) w \, dw.}{
      P_i(w) = \int_w^{w+dw} ( N_i(w) + g_i(w) ) w \, dw.}

\eqn{N_i(w)} is the abundance density \eqn{(no./m^{2})} and
\eqn{g_i(w)} is the energy rate available for growth after metabolism
and movement have been accounted for \eqn{(grams/year)}.
The productivity is calculated for all fish in the size range between
\code{min_fishing_length} and \code{max_fishing_length}. These lengths can be the
same for all groups or can be specified as a vector with one value for
each species in the model. The minimum length defaults to \eqn{7 cm}
regardless of species group and maximum length defaults to the
maximum weight in the model.
